The capstone is the last course in the specialization where you have to do 3 simple peer-graded assignments and have an optional capstone assignment. I will not post the peer-graded assignments here, as these are pretty straightforward.
I created another project called "deathrow" here on Github where you can find all the data concering my capstone project.
