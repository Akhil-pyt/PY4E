Lectured by Dr. Charles Severance @ Coursera: http://www.coursera.org

Here you can find all the assignments for the Python for everybody specialization course which I took from June til December 2016 on Coursera.
I did all the assignments with python 2.7. You will need SQLite for some of the assignments.
