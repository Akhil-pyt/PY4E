Retrieving GEOData

#Download the code from http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/geodata.zip - then unzip the file and edit where.data to 
#add an address nearby where you live - don't reveal your actual location. Then run the geoload.py to lookup all of the 
#entries in where.data (including the new one) and produce the geodata.sqlite. Then run geodump.py to read the database and 
#produce where.js. Then open where.html to visualize the map. Take screen shots as described below.
